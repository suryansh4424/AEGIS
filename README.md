# AEGIS

In todayâ€™s digital world, secure communication and data protection are essential. However, understanding and applying cryptographic techniques can be challenging for both developers and users. Many existing solutions either lack intuitive educational features or fail to incorporate robust DevOps practices, which are vital for ensuring application reliability, security, and scalability.
To address these challenges, our project aims to create a web application that serves as an educational platform for various cryptographic methods while integrating modern DevOps practices. The application will feature an interactive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to explore and understand different encryption and decryption techniques, such as Caesar Cipher, RSA Encryption, and AES Encryption.
